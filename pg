# Build Notes

If builds of PostgreSQL 9 are failing and you have version 8.x installed,
you may need to remove the previous version first. See:
  https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/issue/2510

To build plpython against a specific Python, set PYTHON prior to brewing:
  PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python  brew install postgresql
See:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/install-procedure.html

# Create/Upgrade a Database

If this is your first install, create a database with:
  initdb /usr/local/var/postgres -E utf8

To migrate existing data from a previous major version (pre-9.2) of PostgreSQL, see:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/upgrading.html

# Loading Extensions

By default, Homebrew builds all available Contrib extensions.  To see a list of all
available extensions, from the psql command line, run:
  SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;

To load any of the extension names, navigate to the desired database and run:
  CREATE EXTENSION [extension name];

For instance, to load the tablefunc extension in the current database, run:
  CREATE EXTENSION tablefunc;

For more information on the CREATE EXTENSION command, see:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-createextension.html
For more information on extensions, see:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/contrib.html

# Other

Some machines may require provisioning of shared memory:
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/kernel-resources.html#SYSVIPC

To install postgresql (and ossp-uuid) in 32-bit mode:
   brew install postgresql --32-bit

If you want to install the postgres gem, including ARCHFLAGS is recommended:
    env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

To install gems without sudo, see the Homebrew wiki.

To have launchd start postgresql at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load postgresql now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start




You should reload postgresql:
    launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
    createuser -U postgres nilesh -P
